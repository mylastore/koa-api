## General Information

Example seed data: users, blogs

API has a fleshed-out user login/signup/forgot/reset authentication/email verification system using JWT.

### User Authentication Process

User authentication process:

- User creates an account
- User verifies email
- User logs in
- The server sends and `accessToken`
- We take the `accessToken` and decode it using `jwt-decode`. This gets us the logged-in user's information`
- Each protected endpoint will be expecting you to attach the `accessToken` 

### PM2

This project features an `ecosystem.json` file that is the target of the PM2 implementation in production.

The `src` folder is the heart of the program.

### controllers

We use controllers to keep our router thin. 

The controller's responsibility is to manage the request body and make sure it's nice and clean when it eventually

gets sent to a `model` to make database calls.

### db

MongoDB with Mongoose for speed and fairly easy to used.

### middleware

The custom middleware we're using is based on the `koa-jwt` library.

### models

Our models folder where database calls are made and validation is performed

### routes

This is where we do authentication for restricted URL

### index.js

index.js it's the brain of the app.

### Testing

Jest for testing WORK IN PROGRESS - TODO
